## Motivations

I don't really use the Twitch website as I watch streams in VLC using [streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink) so I only used most of the time the Twitch popout chat. With the removal of the legacy popout chat and the new popout chat lacking very important features (like whisper support), I started looking for chat client alternatives providing most features included in the official chat and also some new ones.

As I couldn't find any proper alternative including all my requirements, I decided to build my own.
